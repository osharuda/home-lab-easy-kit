/// \section sect_communication_details_01 Description
/// Software start communication by sending a command byte. Command byte consist of device ID, an identifier unique to each device represented by firmware.
/// It is possible to address up to the 16 such devices. Also command byte may keep up to the 4 additional flags which will be delivered to the device.
/// These flags are passed to the device and every device may react on these flags. It is possible to pass simple commands/states using these flags.
///
/// Communication with firmware is based on commands. Each device should define itâ€™s own command(s) set, but there is general flow that every command should satisfy.
/// Simple devices may use device specific flags allocated in command byte, more complex devices may pass information using command data.
///
/// Software sends data and selects device. If device does not require any data then software may send just #tag_CommCommandHeader to select device. When command received, all communication status flags are cleared.
/// Software waits until device reacts on the command received by reading communication status flags tag_CommResponseHeader#comm_status from device.
/// If device does not answer or #COMM_STATUS_BUSY is set then device is busy, wait should be prolonged.
/// When software is confident that #COMM_STATUS_BUSY is cleared it may reads (optionally) data from the device.
///
/// Software sends data or commands to firmware as buffer which consist of #tag_CommCommandHeader structure and data following this header.
/// To receive data software must select device by sending a command to this device and make sure #COMM_STATUS_BUSY is cleared.
/// Software receives data back from the selected device as #tag_CommResponseHeader structure followed by the device data.
/// The length of read operation is defined by software, so it is possible software reads more data than device buffer has.
/// In this case, #COMM_BAD_BYTE is sent repeatedly and software is responsible for detection and handling of such situation.
/// To do this, software may pay attention on tag_CommResponseHeader#length field, this value is calculated by firmware when read is initiated and is equal to
/// amount of data in the buffer at that moment.
///
/// Master may commit several reads from the device. This behavior is device specific.
///
/// \section sect_communication_details_02 Control sum calculation
/// Control sum is being calculated by firmware on data reception from software. All data bytes, including #tag_CommCommandHeader are XORed (except tag_CommCommandHeader#control_crc), and checked against tag_CommCommandHeader#control_crc.
/// Note, that initial value for control sum is #COMM_CRC_INIT_VALUE.
/// In the case of mismatch firmware discards received buffer and communication status flag #COMM_STATUS_CRC is set.
/// Software reads are checked with use of tag_CommResponseHeader#last_crc . To check control sum software should issue two read operations, the first to read data, and the second to read previous operation control sum.
/// Thus, data integrity is verified on both paths.
